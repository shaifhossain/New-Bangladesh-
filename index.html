        Returning to Bangladesh, Yunus headed the economics department at Chittagong University.

        From 1993 to 1995, Professor Yunus was a member of the International Advisory Group for the Fourth World

      and nutrition to a child in need.Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in reducing child mortality in recent decades. Yet 1 child in every 33 still
      dies from a preventable or treatable cause – half of these are newborns. The children of Bangladesh also face
      malnutrition, child marriage, lack of education and more, risking their very lives and futures.Your support shows that lasting, large-scale change is possible. Last year, we changed the lives of over 2,623,000
      children in Bangladesh. Together, we’re giving them the opportunities every child deserves – to grow up healthy,
      learning and safe.</p>
